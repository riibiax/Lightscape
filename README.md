« Lightscape » is an interactive installation representing the landscape seen by an immigrant during his travel.

Tracking his GPS locations, the artwork uses landscapes' pictures from Flicker and live weather forecast by looking for colors light as faithful as possible.

The top part of the device shows the sky, the bottom part visualizes the soil and the mechanical part represents the silhouette in the landscape. The weather forecast animates the visual show.
